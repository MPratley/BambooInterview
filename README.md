# BamBank

A Bank for Pandas!

This is a simple example webapp written in `koa`+`node`, `sequelize` as an ORM and the frontend rendered from handlebars.

# Running the app

Standard `npm` commands!

```
# First, you'll need to install deps
# This might take a while, as sqlite3 is often installed from source!
npm install

# run the auto-reload development server for a faster debugging experience
npm run dev

# run the production server
npm run prod

# just run the linter
npm run lint
```

Once you're in, head to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

You can create a new account or log in with 
```
jane@example.com
password
# OR
jane2@example.com
password
```
and send bambeuros between accounts
